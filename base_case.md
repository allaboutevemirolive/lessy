# BASE CASE 1

INPUT :

Controlling How Tests Are Run
Just as cargo run compiles your code and then runs the resulting binary, cargo test compiles your code in test mode and runs the resulting test binary. 
The default behavior of the binary produced by cargo test is to run all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test runs, preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the output related to the test results. 
You can, however, specify command line options to change this default behavior.
