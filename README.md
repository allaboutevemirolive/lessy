# Lessy

Lessy is a Rust library for text processing and manipulation. It simplify concatenated sentences into easily readable sentences, enhancing comprehension through the addition of blank spaces between each sentence.

## Features

- **Insert Blank Spaces:** Insert blank spaces in the text for improved readability or formatting.
- **Line Deletion:** Delete entire lines from the text based on specific criteria.
- **Specific Word Delection**
- **Regex Detection**
- **Text Processing:** Perform custom text processing operations such as replacing text, splitting sentences, and more.

## Notes

Lessy is still in its early stages, but you can get the most out of it. The coding is straightforward, and you may begin by running the command 'cargo init' and then navigate to the src folder.
